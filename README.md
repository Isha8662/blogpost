My project is a blogpost called" Isha's Art Blog. I made it just to analyze the works of 2 artists; Vincent Van Gogh and Pablo Picasso, and write about my opinions on their art technique. You can click on their names on the website to read about my art analysis. I used CSS. Python, and HTML using a flask framework to code my website. One thing I struggled with was figuring out why there was a gap between the top  of the screen and the header. I learned that I can use the F12 key to see the code on the website, and was able to play around with the margin to get rid of the gap. I also learned that you can make a negative margin, which I used to fix the issue.
