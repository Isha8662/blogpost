When I look at Leonid Afreomovs artworks, the bursts of coordinated colors always blow me away. I love the way he is able to incorporate vivid and strong colors into his artwork, while letting the palate match and allowing everything to blend together gracefully. Although the artworks are electric and robust the simple landscapes Afremov picks to paint balances everything out. Leonid Afrerov is a promenti user of th erImpasto technique. Just like Van Gogh, he is able to create movement with this technique, and dramzite his paintings even more. Creating this much texture within his paintings allos the vivid colored palette to create more emotion within the viewer.
