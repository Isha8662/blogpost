Recently I have been getting really into the artworks of Vincent Van Gogh. I never understood how a man that was spiraling mentally was able to create such simplistic and almost ordinary paintings. You would never expect that a painting of a landscape, or arguably the most famous painting of all time, Starry Night, being made by a bipolar man who cut off his ear in one of his manic episodes. In his last 70 days, Van Gogh painted 70 paintings before commiting suicide, after losing his battle with mental illlness. These paintings gave him sustenance, as in his last 70 days he seemingly returned to a positive mental state, where he became encapsulated with his surroundings. Although a quick glance at his paintings would never reveal any of the inner turmoil he faced, a more open and emotional examination would allow the viewer to see how the swirls in Starry Night create a sense of wonder and loneliness, instead of just labeling them as lines in the sky. 

Since I have mentioned Starry Night a couple of times now, I decided that it should be the first we talk about. Starry Night  was made in June 1889, and created presumably to depict the vastness of the universe and the mind. Using "Impasto", A technique where thick paint is applied to a canvas, to create texture and to dramatize the shapes of the brushstroke that were left imprinted. The use of the impasto technique also created movement within the painting. The swirling brushstrokes furthermore dramatized the painting, adding more tension to it. The use of bold colors like white, yellow, and light blue created major contrast in the painting, drawing attention, and creating emphasis.
